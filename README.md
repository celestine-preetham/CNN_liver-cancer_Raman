# CNN_liver_cancer_Raman

The convolutional neural network (CNN) in this repo is used to identify the Raman spectra of liver tissue samples with different pathologic types.

This repository is adapted from the codebase used to produce the results in the paper "Histopathological diagnosis of liver cancer based on Raman spectroscopy and deep learning."

# This repo should contain the following files:

**datasets**  containing the code for  setting up datasets

**model_vgg.py**  containing VGG-16-based CNN model

**Raman_training.py**  containing the code for loading the dataset, training and validating the CNN model 

**Raman_testing**  containing the code for testing the CNN model and giving a classification result 

**Demo data** containing spectral data collected from liver cancer and adjacent non-tumour tissue

In demo data, data from cancer tissues were labelled as "1", while data from paracancer tissues were labelled as "0"
